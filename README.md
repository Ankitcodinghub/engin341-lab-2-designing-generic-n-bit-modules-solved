Part 1. Designing Generic N-bit Modules

Step 1-1: Modify your 2-bit Ripple Carry Adder design from Lab 1 to operate on N-bit wide

operands, using generic and generate statements.

Step 1-2: Create a testbench that stimulates the inputs to all possible combinations and observes the outputs. Generate a simulated timing diagram and a truth table for a 2-bit instantiation of the Unit Under Test (UUT).

Step 1-3: For the subtract function, you will need to first create a full subtractor. You will need this full subtractor to create an N-bit Ripple Carry Subtractor design. Follow the same design and testbench practices as in the N-bit Ripple Carry Adder design. Generate a simulated timing diagram and a truth table for a 2-bit instantiation of UUT.

Figure 1: Full Subtractor Diagram

Step 1-4: You should notice after simulating the Subtractor, that the output of negative numbers will produce the binary representation of a negative number. For example, 0010 ‚Äì 0100 should produce 1110 with a borrow out, or overflow, of 1. Unfortunately, this won‚Äôt display as ‚Äò-2‚Äô automatically on your seven segment display. Instead you should see ‚ÄòE‚Äô, with the overflow LED on for the negative sign (-). The simplest way to fix this is to use two‚Äôs complement.

You have been provided a Two‚Äôs Complement function to use in your design, however you are still expected to understand how it has been implemented and what it does. Figure 3 shows a circuit diagram of the XOR/OR gate network that outputs the two‚Äôs complement of a 5-bit number. The resulting logic is simple, the first bit is always the same, then the following bits will either remain unchanged or be inverted, depending on if any of the bits preceding it are 1‚Äôs. This design follows the ‚Äústarting from the least significant bit, going towards the most significant bit: copy each 0 until you get to the first 1, copy the first 1, and then invert all other bits‚Äù two‚Äôs complement conversion method and implements it using a cascaded XOR/OR gate chain.

As it can be seen from Figure 2, the implementation of this function results in a repeatable hardware structure starting from the output of the second bit. Each following bit uses exactly one more OR and one more XOR gate.

Part 2. Designing the Overflow and Output Multiplexors

Step 2-1: Design a 1-bit 2-to-1 Multiplexor (MUX) using the ‚Äúwith SEL select‚Äù dataflow construct. The output of this mux will then be used to light an on-board LED to indicate overflow, which in the case of a subtraction means a negative number.

Step 2-2: To select a single function‚Äôs output to display on the Seven Segment LED display, a multiplexer needs to be designed, that uses the Function Select input as the select, and the function outputs as its inputs. What needs to be done next is to design a MUX that selects which one of the 11 function outputs will pass through to the Seven_Segment_Driver (SSDriver.vhd). This is the Output MUX in the ALU block diagram. The simplest way to do this is with the VHDL select statement, which you can see an example of its use in the Seven_Segment_Driver. Map the Output MUX‚Äôs inputs to the Function Select in accordance with Table 1. For all remaining unused inputs (Function Select values 1011 to 1111), make sure to specify the output as undefined (‚ÄòU‚Äô std_logic). Also make sure to use a generic value that defines the bit-width of the operands passed in and out of the MUX.

*Because Overflow Mux uses the rightmost bit to select between the Add and Subtract functions, it‚Äôs important that the rightmost bit of the Two‚Äôs Complement matches that of the Subtract function, otherwise you won‚Äôt get the correct overflow for the Two‚Äôs Complement output.

Part 3. ALU Mixed Modeling Design

Step 3-1: Create an ALU.vhd file with an ALU module that has the same ports as the ALU shown in Figure 1, except that the inputs A and B, and the output R should be defined as generic N-bit wide vectors. Declare components for the N-bit Ripple Carry Adder and Subtractor, the Output MUX, the Overflow MUX, and for the Two‚Äôs Complement modules. Instantiate each one of the components within the ALU architecture once. Connect the outputs of the Adder, Subtractor, and Two‚Äôs Complement internal functions to the inputs of the Output MUX. Make sure to follow the assignment order shown in Table 2, and Figure 1. Connect the overflow bits of the Adder and Subtractor modules to the 2-to-1 Overflow MUX, and make sure to assign the least significant bit of the Function Select input as the select input to the 2-to-1 Overflow MUX instantiation.

Step 3-2: For the remaining binary and unary operators, use dataflow assignments to internal ALU architecture signals, and then connect these signals to the Output MUX in the order shown in Table 2, and Figure 1.

Step 3-3: Write a testbench for the ALU. Verify that it works as intended before proceeding. Simulate with the test vectors shown in the Lab Work part 6. Save the resulting waveform and truth table and include them in your lab report.

Part 4. Top-Level Design

Step 4-1: Create a Lab2.vhd file that instantiates and interconnects, as shown in Figure 1, one ALU and one 7-Segment Driver, a module which was provided to you. Map the instantiated ALU‚Äôs generic to 4 bits. Synthesize the design. Review the elaborated schematic to make sure the RTL design synthesized mimics the RTL design shown in Figure 1.

Step 4-2: You will be using Vivado‚Äôs I/O Planning tool in order to design your constraints file. However, before you can do this, you will need to know which pins to assign your inputs and outputs to. You have been provided two PMOD devices for this lab. The first is a set of four additional switches. The schematic for this PMOD device is shown in Figure 4.

Figure 3. Four Switch PMOD Device Diagram

Refer to the PMOD section of the ZYBO Reference Manual for how to use the PMOD ports. This will also be how you determine the pin name and number specifics that you will need to assign in the constraints file. These switches should be used for your control input, while the onboard switches and buttons should be used for the two binary number inputs. Your constraints should match the assignments listed in Table 3.

Step 4-3: The second PMOD device you have been provided is a Seven Segment Display. The schematic for this PMOD accessory is shown in Figure 5. This device actually allows for two digits to be displayed, however, for this lab you will only be using the first digit.

Figure 4. Seven Segment Display PMOD Device Diagram

When connecting the seven segment display to the onboard PMOD ports, make sure to use two of the High-Speed PMOD Ports, as only one standard PMOD port has been provided and this device requires two ports. This means you should use only PMOD JB, JC, or JD. As you will only be using one of the seven segment displays, you do not need to do anything with the common cathode. You only need to assign pins for P1-P4 of the J1 Connector, and P1-P3 of the J2 Connector.

Step 4-4: Finally, for the overflow LED, you should use one of the available onboard LEDs. Your board should match the one showed below if the correct PMOD ports as used in the constraints file. Make sure when plugging in the PMOD devices that they are placed in the top row of each of the PMOD ports.
